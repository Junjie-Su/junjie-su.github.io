I am an undergraduate student in Cyberspace Security (Experimental Class) at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), with research interests in **AI Agents**, **Trustworthy AI**, and **Adversarial Machine Learning**.
Previously, I conducted research under [Prof. Jie Hao](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/3808.htm) at the [National Engineering Research Center of Disaster Backup and Recovery](http://www.zaibei.org.cn/).
Currently, I am working with [Prof. Jun Liu](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/liujun/zh_CN/index/64453/list/), focusing on AI Agents for the next four years.
