I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Cyberspace Security (Experimental Class) at 
[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/).
My research interests lie in **AI Agent**, **Trustworthy AI**, and **Adversarial Machine Learning**.
I have been working under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Hao](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/3808.htm) in the [National Engineering Research Center of Disaster Backup and Recovery](http://www.zaibei.org.cn/).

Projects
======
**AI Table Tennis — Full-Process Intelligent Tournament System**  
*Entrepreneurial Project | National Level*  
*Software Engineer* — *Sept 2023 – Oct 2024*  
- Leveraged professional knowledge of table tennis competitions and extensive event-organizing experience to deeply contribute to the platform’s business logic design, resolving issues such as unattractive interfaces and the lack of intelligent event management in existing platforms.  
- Developed front-end pages using the WeChat Mini Program technology stack and Vant2 components, creating several highly reusable component templates that enhanced team development efficiency.  
- Built the back-end with SpringBoot2 and PostgreSQL13, implementing legality checks for competition information and enabling multimedia data storage and retrieval on a SaaS platform.

Work Experience
=======
**Antiy Technology Group Co., Ltd.**  
*Technical Committee/Security Development Engineer (Intern)* — *Jul 2024 – Aug 2024*  
- Utilized tools such as IDA, GDA, and JEB Pro to perform reverse analysis on Android applications, identifying logical vulnerabilities and stack overflow vulnerabilities.  
- Developed the Android reverse analysis tool SmaliAnalyzer, optimizing the decompilation of try-catch blocks in the Smali language, and enabling the decompilation of code blocks into Java that some professional software like JEB Pro could not directly decompile.  

Student Work
=======
**BUPT Table Tennis Association**  
*President* — *Sept 2023 – Jul 2024*  
- Led a core team of 40 as president, overseeing the planning and execution of all association activities.
