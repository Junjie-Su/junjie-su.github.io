This summer, I aimed to secure an algorithm internship, so I submitted my resume to Tencent two months ago. After hearing nothing for weeks, I was surprised last week to receive an interview invitation from Tencent’s Gaming group for a security-tech position. I suspect they reached out because of my previous internship at a security company, where I worked as a security development engineer. However, since I’m now focused on AI, I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about this role, nor did I feel well-suited for it. My security experience was quite dated, and I haven’t worked on traditional security tasks since then. Still, it was my first opportunity, so I decided to give it a try—for the experience and a bit of fun.

## First impression

The interview didn’t start well. The interviewer kept his camera off while mine was on, which felt a bit unbalanced. **He didn’t give me a chance to introduce myself** and dove straight into questions about my experience with Android reverse engineering. Even though I approached the interview as practice, **the lack of warmth or structure made it a disappointing experience**. I couldn’t help but think this was a “KPI-driven” interview—more about checking boxes than genuine interest. Oh well, I wasn’t set on this role anyway, so I treated it as a learning opportunity.

## Main content

I candidly shared my experience at the security company, starting with practicing CTF challenges, moving on to working with real programs, and eventually discussing the results I achieved. As a sophomore at the time, I didn’t know much, so my contributions were modest. Since I’m not planning a career in security, I didn’t embellish—just answered honestly. The interviewer’s responses were casual, and he didn’t probe further. He probably sensed my limited expertise and saw no need to dig deeper.

When the conversation shifted to my research, the interviewer’s tone relaxed. Research is my current strength, so I eagerly explained my recent submission to UAI, covering some basic technical principles. The interviewer, likely unfamiliar with this area, asked only surface-level questions, which I answered easily. He didn’t press for details, perhaps because my work on audio security was far removed from their game security focus. Reflecting later, I realized **I probably shared too much technical detail**. **For a role mismatch like this, it’s better to highlight learning ability and potential** rather than diving deep into unrelated specifics.

After covering my security-related experience, the interviewer threw me a curveball: a logic puzzle called the “[Six Wolves River Crossing.](https://blog.csdn.net/kaidishi/article/details/10142633)” I was caught off guard—maybe my basic security knowledge prompted this shift. Initially, I misunderstood the problem and rushed to answer. After clarifying the constraints, ten minutes passed as I puzzled over it, but I still couldn’t crack it. Feeling stuck, I asked for a hint, only to be told that a hint would essentially give away the answer. Defeated, I gave up, and that marked the end of the interview. Looking back, I realized **I was halfway to a solution when I asked for the hint**. **If I’d trusted myself and kept thinking, I might have solved it**—a bit of a missed opportunity.

## Questions for the Interviewer

Since I didn’t solve the puzzle, the interview wrapped up quickly, moving to the “ask the interviewer” phase. Honestly, this was my main goal anyway—learning more for the sake of experience. I asked about their team’s focus and whether they worked with AI. They mentioned some AI use, mostly for analyzing player behavior, which sounded like tabular data analysis. I also inquired if other Tencent departments worked on AI security, like Xuanwu Lab, but the interviewer wasn’t sure. With little else to explore, I thanked him and logged off.

## Takeaways

The interview lasted 30 minutes: 20 minutes of Q&A about my experience and 10 minutes derailed by the logic puzzle. **I’d never prepared for puzzles like that**, and I didn’t expect to encounter one in my first big-tech interview. **Lesson learned—I’ll brush up on these for next time**. Overall, the interview wasn’t a success, but as my first experience with a major company, it was a valuable stepping stone. I hit some pitfalls and didn’t get lucky, but that’s okay.

This is just the beginning. I’m not fixated on Tencent—any algorithm role at a top company would be great. While waiting for Tencent’s response, I’ve applied to other major firms as well. My goal is to use a summer internship to understand how algorithms are applied in industry, preparing me for a job after grad school. There’s no rush—I’ll take it easy and keep moving forward!
